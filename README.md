# AccessibilityPostcards
Plain English translations of accessibility standards

The postcards are divided into 4 catagories or areas: visual, aural, mobility and cognative.

The idea is to use them to generate discussion leading to design and test decisions.

Each card explains a single concept with real life applicable examples of the principle being talked about.

Delivery teams can use these cards in activities like:
  * Taking part in the 3 amigos / 3 hats / Triforce sessions
  * Coaching
  * Knowledge sharing
  * Illustrate or demonstrate a talking point atound accessibility
